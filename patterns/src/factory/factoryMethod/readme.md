# Factory Method Design Pattern
***
## Why need it?
* The Factory Method allows subclass to design create which instance, which easy to extend and easy to handler the logic.

## What the Factory Method pattern?
> Define an interface for creating items, and let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. 
> Factory methods defer the instantiation of a class to its subclasses.

## Props
* The process of hiding object instantiation
* Different kinds can be obtained from the factory through the argument.

## Cons
* To write many factories will increase the complexity of the code.
